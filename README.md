### ``$ whoami``

This is some of the stuff that I do from time to time:

#### Linux Distribution Work

Sorted new to old:

- [Slackware - riscv64 port](https://github.com/fede2cr/slackware_riscv): Slackware, the port for riscv64.
- [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/inside-gentoo/developers/retired-developers.html#fede2): Retired developer. Used gentoo a lot for modifying and testing the compilation options, to understand how to get a bit more speed on the UltraSparc architecture. I worked there on getting more packages to the UltraSparc achitecture.
- [Splack Linux](https://github.com/fede2cr/splack_linux): Slackware for Sparc and UltraSparc, active between 2001-2006. It had releases for several versions, and was mirrored my many free software "mirrors" around the world. At least two universities (in Costa Rica and Norway) had servers running in production with this distro. I'd like to continue with this project, but UltraSparc machines are expensive to get, and to ship to Costa Rica. Contact me if you'd like to donate hardware to the project.

#### Linux Kernel Work

- [XFS on sparc64](): I did some testing for the SGI folks, testing how well XFS worked on a 64bit computer. Back in those days, very little archs were 64bits, so I like to think that some of the stability that XFS has on x86-64 and aarch64 might have come from this efforts.
- [General sparc64 stuff](): The one in the link is a bit of a fight I had with hacker kernel extrordinaire Alan Cox, were some of the patches he was sending to lkml, broke audio on machines like the Blade100 from Sun. I was told that later patches would fix that, but they never came, so I think that to this day, it might be broken still. Did I won? Nope, no one won that day.
